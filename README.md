# Lyricod for Windows

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Lyricod displays synced lyrics on Windows, with word-by-word highlighting, desktop lyrics, a lyric island at the top of the screen, and a separate lyrics window.

It works with Spotify, QQ Music, NetEase Cloud Music, Apple Music, and supported browser music players. Translations, pronunciation, timing, and appearance can be customized.

## Ways to view lyrics

### Lyricod Island

The island sits at the top of your screen and highlights lyrics word by word as the song plays. It adjusts its width to the current line and can show translations, pronunciation, or the next line. Lyric colours can follow the album artwork or use a colour you choose.

Hovering over the island can expand it into a mini player or hide it temporarily so you can use what's behind it. There is also an option to choose the action based on which direction the pointer enters from. The island can fade out after playback pauses.

### Desktop lyrics

Display one or two lines above other windows. When locked, clicks pass through the lyrics. Unlock them to drag the lyrics to a different position.

### Lyrics window

View the whole song in a separate window, with optional album artwork in the background. Lyrics scroll with playback, and clicking a line seeks to that point in the song. Press F11 for full screen.

Lyricod also runs in the system tray. Open its tray panel to control playback, toggle lyric views, choose lyrics, or adjust the current song's timing. Global shortcuts are available for common actions.

## Supported players

Lyricod reads playback information through Windows media controls. If a player appears there, Lyricod can usually follow it. This includes Spotify, QQ Music, NetEase Cloud Music, Apple Music, and some browser music players.

When multiple players are open, Lyricod follows the one currently playing by default. You can also select a player in Settings > General.

Some players do not report an accurate playback position. In that case, Lyricod keeps time itself, which may cause lyrics to drift after pausing or seeking. See the NetEase Cloud Music section below for details.

For videos in browsers, Lyricod only displays lyrics when it can match the content to a song. You can disable lyric searches for browsers and other apps in Settings > Lyrics.

## Lyrics sources

Lyricod searches NetEase Cloud Music, QQ Music, and [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net). Depending on the song and source, results may include word-by-word or line-synced lyrics, translations, and pronunciation. Lyrics are cached on your PC for later playback.

If Lyricod finds the wrong song, open Choose Lyrics to compare search results and preview the lyrics before selecting one. Your choice and any timing adjustment are saved for that song, even if you clear the lyrics cache.

You can adjust lyric timing from the tray panel or Settings > Lyrics.

## Download and install

Download the version for your PC from [Releases](https://github.com/Indarkdust/Lyricod-App/releases):

- **x64**: for most Windows PCs with Intel or AMD processors.
- **ARM64**: for Windows PCs with Arm processors.
- **Installer (setup.exe)**: installs for the current user without administrator access.
- **Portable (zip)**: extract the archive and run `Lyricod.exe`. Keep the `app` folder next to it.

Lyricod runs in the Windows system tray after launch. If no window appears, look for its icon in the notification area.

The app is currently unsigned, so Windows may display a warning the first time it runs. Check where you downloaded the file before deciding whether to proceed.

Lyricod checks for updates once a day. You can disable this in Settings > About. Both installed and portable versions support in-app updates, or you can download a new version manually.

Settings and cached lyrics are stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lyricod` and are kept during updates. Uninstalling the app does not remove this folder; delete it manually if you want to remove the data as well.

## NetEase Cloud Music lyrics out of sync?

NetEase Cloud Music generally reports which song is playing but does not provide Windows with its playback position. Lyricod therefore tracks time itself, so lyrics may drift after you pause or seek.

For more accurate synchronization, you can use **InfLink-rs**, a third-party plugin that runs through **BetterNCM**. Both are maintained by other developers and change how NetEase Cloud Music runs. Install them only if you are comfortable with that.

1. Quit NetEase Cloud Music. Download and run `betterncm_installer.exe` from [BetterNCM Installer releases](https://github.com/std-microblock/BetterNCM-Installer/releases/latest).
2. Open NetEase Cloud Music and install **InfLink-rs** from the BetterNCM plugin store. Alternatively, download `InfLink-rs.plugin` from [InfLink-rs releases](https://github.com/apoint123/inflink-rs/releases/latest) and copy it to `C:\betterncm\plugins`.
3. Restart NetEase Cloud Music and enable **SMTC** in the InfLink-rs settings.

Lyricod will detect the additional playback information automatically. You can check this in Settings > About > Diagnostics.

InfLink-rs has been tested with NetEase Cloud Music 3.1.20 through 3.1.41 and 2.10.13. If a player update causes problems, check for an updated plugin. BetterNCM can be removed by deleting `msimg32.dll` from the NetEase Cloud Music installation folder. Do not install the older InfLink alongside InfLink-rs.

## Customization

You can change lyric fonts, sizes, colours, backgrounds, translations, pronunciation, island animations and sizing, hover behaviour, and global shortcuts. The island, desktop lyrics, and lyrics window have separate display settings.

Lyrics use Microsoft YaHei by default. You can choose another installed font or download **MiSans** by Xiaomi from Settings. MiSans is not bundled with Lyricod and is subject to Xiaomi's licence.

## Privacy

To find lyrics, Lyricod sends the song title, artist, and duration to NetEase Cloud Music, QQ Music, and LRCLIB. If lyric lookups for browsers and other apps are enabled, the title and artist or channel of content playing there may also be used in searches. You can turn this off in Settings > Lyrics. No additional information about your browsing or viewing is sent.

The island's audio bars use Windows audio APIs to read audio information from the current player. Lyricod does not record, save, or upload audio. You can disable music-reactive bars in Settings > Lyricod Island.

Automatic update checks contact GitHub once a day and can be disabled in Settings > About.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 version 1809 or newer, x64 or ARM64.
- Music-reactive audio bars require Windows 11. On Windows 10, they use a preset animation.
